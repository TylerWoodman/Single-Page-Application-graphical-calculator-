This is my single page application for COMP 1004 computer science , i have decided to create a graphical calculator that can take in polynomials and trigonometric equations and output the graphical version of this onto a canvas. It will show not only the line, but also the turning point , if present , and the x and y intercepts will also be labelled. There is a simple log in system in place that will take in a email and password and then allow you to sign up and log in with these credentials.
